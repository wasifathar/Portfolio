# Lanyard Assets

## Required Files

You need to download these two files and place them in this folder:

1. **card.glb** - The 3D model file for the card
2. **lanyard.png** - The texture file for the lanyard band

## Where to Get Them

Download from: https://reactbits.dev/default/Components/Lanyard

Look in the repo's files under `src/assets/lanyard/` folder.

## Editing the Assets

1. **card.glb** - You can edit this file in the online .glb editor:
   - https://modelviewer.dev/editor/
   - You can change the texture/material here

2. **lanyard.png** - Edit this in any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
   - This is the texture for the lanyard's band

## Notes

- The component is already configured to use these files
- Make sure both files are in this exact folder: `src/assets/lanyard/`
- The component will automatically import them once you add the files
